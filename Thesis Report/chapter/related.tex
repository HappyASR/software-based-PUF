\section{Key Generator}

In this section, there are two scheme for key generation produced by Hyunho Kang et. al. Both constructions were built on 2014. The first construction, shown in \ref{fig:cryptographic_key_generation_old}, is utilizing random number generator (RNG). This design was perfected in the second design shown in \ref{fig:cryptographic_key_generation}. In the second design, random number generator was removed without affecting the security.

\section{Key Storage using PUF Scheme}

In a basic key storage scheme using PUF, it usually divided into two phases.  In the first phase, generally called enrollment, the helper data is constructed by XOR-ing PUF bits and the encoded key. In the second phase, which called reconstruction, the helper data is XOR-ed with the PUF bits, followed by decoding the result to reconstruct the key.

\section{Authentication using PUF Scheme}

In a basic authentication scheme using PUF, it usually divided into two phases.  In the first phase, generally called enrollment, CRPs are generated and stored in a CRP database. In the second phase, usually referred to verification, a challenge from the CRP database is applied to the PUF and the response produced by the PUF is compared with the corresponding response from the database.
