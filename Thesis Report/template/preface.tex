% TODO MOTIVATION FOR RESEARCH TOPIC
One of the main reasons why I am attracted to the field of computer science and engineering is the opportunity to develop useful products for society. An example which reflects this possibility is the open source project. Numerous people from around the world and different backgrounds are delved together to solve many issues continuously.

Sadly, when I start looking for a thesis topic, I realized that there is a subfield of computer security that still lacks public involvement. This field is called physically unclonable functions (PUF). On one hand, there are already a lot of papers published and even some companies already sell some products based on this concept. On the other hand, there is no repository or project that initiate the public participation and provide working codes to get into a real product on this topic. There is some PUF-related public repository but it only offers PUF simulation. This may be also one of the reasons why PUF is not popular for common people even though it promised an excellent security feature. Based on this reason, I decided to delve into this problem and working on a thesis project which aim to provide the first open source PUF platform. In addition, due to the rise of self-sovereign identity concept, we also provide a secure data and key storage scheme based on the constructed PUF platform.
