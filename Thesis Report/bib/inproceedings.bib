  abstract="Shannon entropy is a useful and important measure in information processing, for instance, data compression or randomness extraction, under the assumption---which can typically safely be made in communication theory---that a certain random experiment is independently repeated many times. In cryptography, however, where a system's working has to be proven with respect to a malicious adversary, this assumption usually translates to a restriction on the latter's knowledge or behavior and is generally not satisfied. An example is quantum key agreement, where the adversary can attack each particle sent through the quantum channel differently or even carry out coherent attacks, combining a number of particles together. In information-theoretic key agreement, the central functionalities of information reconciliation and privacy amplification have, therefore, been extensively studied in the scenario of general distributions: Partial solutions have been given, but the obtained bounds are arbitrarily far from tight, and a full analysis appeared to be rather involved to do. We show that, actually, the general case is not more difficult than the scenario of independent repetitions---in fact, given our new point of view, even simpler. When one analyzes the possible efficiency of data compression and randomness extraction in the case of independent repetitions, then Shannon entropy H is the answer. We show that H can, in these two contexts, be generalized to two very simple quantities---                                                                          {\$}H{\_}0^{\backslash}epsilon{\$}                 and                                                                           {\$}H{\_}{\backslash}infty^{\backslash}epsilon{\$}                , called smooth R{\'e}nyi entropies---which are tight bounds for data compression (hence, information reconciliation) and randomness extraction (privacy amplification), respectively. It is shown that the two new quantities, and related notions, do not only extend Shannon entropy in the described contexts, but they also share central properties of the latter such as the chain rule as well as sub-additivity and monotonicity.",

  abstract="Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) have properties that make them very attractive for a variety of security-related applications. Due to their inherent dependency on the physical properties of the device that contains them, they can be used to uniquely bind an application to a particular device for the purpose of IP protection. This is crucial for the protection of FPGA applications against illegal copying and distribution. In order to exploit the physical nature of PUFs for reliable cryptography a so-called helper data algorithm or fuzzy extractor is used to generate cryptographic keys with appropriate entropy from noisy and non-uniform random PUF responses. In this paper we present for the first time efficient implementations of fuzzy extractors on FPGAs where the efficiency is measured in terms of required hardware resources. This fills the gap of the missing building block for a full FPGA IP protection solution. Moreover, in this context we propose new architectures for the decoders of Reed-Muller and Golay codes, and show that our solutions are very attractive from both the area and error correction capability points of view.",

An approach based on an error correcting code was proposed by Dodis et al., which is known as a fuzzy extractor. Physical unclonable functions (PUFs) generate device-specific data streams, although PUFs are noisy functions. In this paper, we describe a method for preparing a PUF key during fuzzy extractor implementation. The experimental results showed that all possible combinations of input message length and the number of correctable errors were tested for a BCH code with codeword length N, which was the length of the PUF responses.",

  abstract="In spite of the central role of key derivation functions (KDF) in applied cryptography, there has been little formal work addressing the design and analysis of general multi-purpose KDFs. In practice, most KDFs (including those widely standardized) follow ad-hoc approaches that treat cryptographic hash functions as perfectly random functions. In this paper we close some gaps between theory and practice by contributing to the study and engineering of KDFs in several ways. We provide detailed rationale for the design of KDFs based on the extract-then-expand approach; we present the first general and rigorous definition of KDFs and their security that we base on the notion of computational extractors; we specify a concrete fully practical KDF based on the HMAC construction; and we provide an analysis of this construction based on the extraction and pseudorandom properties of HMAC. The resultant KDF design can support a large variety of KDF applications under suitable assumptions on the underlying hash function; particular attention and effort is devoted to minimizing these assumptions as much as possible for each usage scenario.",

abstract="We present PUFKY: a practical and modular design for a cryptographic key generator based on a Physically Unclonable Function (PUF). A fully functional reference implementation is developed and successfully evaluated on a substantial set of FPGA devices. It uses a highly optimized ring oscillator PUF (ROPUF) design, producing responses with up to 99{\%} entropy. A very high key reliability is guaranteed by a syndrome construction secure sketch using an efficient and extremely low-overhead BCH decoder. This first complete implementation of a PUF-based key generator, including a PUF, a BCH decoder and a cryptographic entropy accumulator, utilizes merely 17{\%} (1162slices) of the available resources on a low-end FPGA, of which 82{\%} are occupied by the ROPUF and only 18{\%} by the key generation logic. PUFKY is able to produce a cryptographically secure 128-bit key with a failure rate <{\thinspace}10−{\thinspace}9 in 5.62ms. The design's modularity allows for rapid and scalable adaptations for other PUF implementations or for alternative key requirements. The presented PUFKY core is immediately deployable in an embedded system, e.g. by connecting it to an embedded microcontroller through a convenient bus interface.",

abstract="In this work we utilize a physically unclonable function (PUF) to improve resilience of authentication protocols to various types of compromise. As an example application, we consider users who authenticate at an ATM using their bank-issued PUF and a password. We present a scheme that is provably secure and achieves strong security properties. In particular, we ensure that (i) the user is unable to authenticate without her device; (ii) the device cannot be used by someone else to successfully authenticate as the user; (iii) the device cannot be duplicated (e.g., by a bank employee); (iv) an adversary with full access to the bank's personal and authentication records is unable to impersonate the user even if he obtains access to the device before and/or after the setup; (v) the device does not need to store any information. We also give an extension that endows the solution with emergency capabilities: if a user is coerced into opening her secrets and giving the coercer full access to the device, she gives the coercer alternative secrets whose use notifies the bank of the coercion in such a way that the coercer is unable to distinguish between emergency and normal operation of the protocol.",

The resulting protocol provides mutual multifactor authentication between client and server and establishes a session key between the authenticated parties, important features that were not found simultaneously in the literature of PUF-based authentication. The combination can be adapted to support a panic password which allows the client to notify the server in case of emergency. Moreover, a novel protocol for two-factor transaction authentication is proposed. This ensures that only parties authenticated in the current session can realize valid bank transactions.",

abstract="In cryptography it is assumed that adversaries only have black box access to the secret keys of honest parties. In real life, however, the black box approach is not sufficient because attackers have access to many physical means that enable them to derive information on the secret keys. In order to limit the attacker's ability to read out secret information, the concept of Algorithmic Tamper Proof (ATP) security is needed as put forth by Gennaro, Lysyanskaya, Malkin, Micali and Rabin. An essential component to achieve ATP security is read-proof hardware. In this paper, we develop an implementation of read-proof hardware that is resistant against invasive attacks. The construction is based on a hardware and a cryptographic part. The hardware consists of a protective coating that contains a lot of randomness. By performing measurements on the coating a fingerprint is derived. The cryptographic part consists of a Fuzzy Extractor that turns this fingerprint into a secure key. Hence no key is present in the non-volatile memory of the device. It is only constructed at the time when needed, and deleted afterwards. A practical implementation of the hardware and the cryptographic part is given. Finally, experimental evidence is given that an invasive attack on an IC equipped with this coating, reveals only a small amount of information on the key.",
