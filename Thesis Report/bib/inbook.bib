abstract="Physical unclonable functions (PUFs) can be used as a cost-effective means to store cryptographic key material in an unclonable way. They can be employed for strong authentication of objects, e.g., tokens, and of persons possessing such tokens, but also for other purposes. We give a short overview of security applications where PUFs are useful, and discuss physical realisations, noisy measurements and information content of PUFs. Then we describe an integrated authentication token containing an optical PUF, a challenging mechanism and a detector. Finally, we discuss authentication protocols for controlled and uncontrolled PUFs.",

abstract="For over four decades, scientists have been scaling devices to increasingly smaller feature sizes (Lewyn et al. 2009; International technology roadmap for semiconductors 2011). This trend is driven by a seemingly unending demand for ever-better performance and by fierce global competition. The steady CMOS technology downscaling is needed to meet requirements on speed, complexity, circuit density, power consumption and ultimately cost required by many advanced applications. However, going to these ultra-scaled CMOS devices also brings some drawbacks.",

abstract="Nowadays, people carry around devices (cell phones, PDAs, bank passes, etc.) that have a high value. That value is often contained in the data stored in it or lies in the services the device can grant access to (by using secret identification information stored in it). These devices often operate in hostile environments and their protection level is not adequate to deal with that situation. Bank passes and credit cards contain a magnetic stripe where identification information is stored. In the case of bank passes, a PIN is additionally required to withdraw money from an ATM (Automated Teller Machine). At various occasions, it has been shown that by placing a small coil in the reader, the magnetic information stored in the stripe can easily be copied and used to produce a cloned card. Together with eavesdropping the PIN (by listening to the keypad or recording it with a camera), an attacker can easily impersonate the legitimate owner of the bank pass by using the cloned card in combination with the eavesdropped PIN.",

abstract="In recent technologies, there is a high demand to integrate large embedded memories in microprocessors and SoCs. In addition, SRAM bitcell area scaling continues to follow an aggressive 50 {\%} reduction each technology node. Technology scaling and the reduction in device sizes increase variations, which have a strong impact on SRAM operation. In this chapter, we review different types of variations that affect SRAM. We start by presenting the SRAM scaling trends in Sect. 2.1. Next, in Sects. 2.2--2.5, we briefly review sources of variability in nanometer CMOS technology including device, interconnect, and environmental variations. The impact of variations on SRAM operation is presented in Sect. 2.6. Due to the similarities between SRAM and logic circuits, techniques to deal with variations logic circuits are presented in Sect. 2.7.",
